## 🌟 My Philosophy

I believe that technology reaches its full potential only when it is driven by a spirit of service. My journey in this field is guided by a clear vocation: **to be of use to others.**

### 🧩 Core Values

* **Child-like Curiosity:** I approach every problem with the wonder and persistence of a child. I am never afraid to ask "why?" or to explore unfamiliar paths to find a solution.
* **Radical Humility:** I see myself as a **humble apprentice sharing a stage with giants.** I am perfectly comfortable being the "last one in line," finding immense value in the opportunity to learn from the geniuses that surround me in this community.
* **Meaningful Contribution:** For me, code is not an end in itself, but a tool for impact. I find my deepest gratification in contributing to projects that provide genuine value and improve people's lives.
